# Introduction

**Web3Fantasy** is a decentralized social platform that allows football fantasy fans the opportunity to create virtual leagues in form of digital assets on the lukso chain, play with other universal profiles, and manage their fantasy team for each game week event. 

It also pitches a decentralized forum where fans and members of any virtual league could chat and discuss about their love for the game. 

#Idea Summary

**Create or Join a virtual fantasy league**

**Build your own  fantasy Team.** The goal is to accumulate as much points as possible from the performance of your squad place in real life gameweek events. For this Demo, Squad info, and event stats are retrieved from [Fantasy Premier League Endpoints]

**Connect with other fans subscribed within the same league** 


# Tools

The LSP7 contract was  deployed using ``` hardhat deploy ```  Client side was boostrapped with [Create React App], [Material UI] and [Material UI kit], and [wepback]. To test it locally, clone the repository. Run ```npm install ``` and then ```npm run serve``` 

# Lukso Tools and Standards

We employed the lukso universal profile extensions for browsers to log users in, interact with the LSP7 contract, and sign transactions

# Fantasy football stats and information

Information about squads, positions and points, and other gameweek stats are gotten from the fantasy premier league endpoints

# What Next

In future, we hope to complete the forum section by persisting and encrypting ipfs hashes via [privy.io]. Other interesting ideas including allowing profiles to create non-free leagues that require a certain amount of token staked and rewarding winners of gameweek events based on total supply. Universal profiles can also buy digital assets such as jerseys and accessories to decorate players

# Team
This experimental project was started  during the lukso buildup hackathon 2022. We hope to find team members who would like to contribute to this exciting idea beyound the hackathon period.
