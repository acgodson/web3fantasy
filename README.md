## Introduction

Web3 fantasy is a decentralized social platform that allows fantasy football fans the opportunity to create virtual leagues in form of digital assets tied to their Lukso Universal Profile, play with other subscribers, and manage their fantasy team for each game week event. 

It also features a decentralized forum where fans and members of any virtual league can chat and discuss about their love for the game.
