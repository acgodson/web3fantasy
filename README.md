 ## Imagine managing a team of your favorite football players on the metaverse--- 

Sure we'll get there.

# Introduction

**Web3Fantasy** is a decentralized social platform that allows football fantasy fans the opportunity to create virtual leagues in form of digital assets tied to their Lukso Universal Profile, play with other subscribers, and manage their fantasy team for each game week event. 

It also pitches a decentralized forum where fans and members of any virtual league could chat and discuss about their love for the game.

# About Web3Fantasy


# Tools

The LSP& contract was  deployed using ``` hardhat deploy ```  The client side is a react app, styled using material UI and material UI kit, and bundled with wepback. To test it locally, clone the repository. Run ```npm install npm run serve```

# Lukso Tools and Standards

We employed the lukso universal profile extensions for browsers to log users in, interact with the LSP7 contract, and sign transactions

# Fantasy football stats and information

Information about player names, positions and points, and each gameweek stats is gotten from the fantasy premier league endpoints


# Team
This experimental project was started by @acgodson during the lukso buildup hackathon 2022. We hope to find more team members who would like to contribute to the project beyound the hackathon period.
